# Programming-for-Crime-Scientists-UCL

The course will introduce students to the Python programming language and to the fundamental concepts underlying programming in general. These concepts include, but are not limited to: data structures, types, iteration, file input/output, and the use of mathematical and statistical packages. In addition to these underlying principles, students will also be exposed (via weekly labs) to computation methods that they can use in analysing real crime-related datasets, such as survey data, crime reports, and DNA data.
