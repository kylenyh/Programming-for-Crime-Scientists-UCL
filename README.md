# Programming-for-Crime-Scientists-UCL

The course will introduce students to the Python programming language and to the fundamental concepts underlying programming in general. These concepts include, but are not limited to: data structures, types, iteration, file input/output, and the use of mathematical and statistical packages. In addition to these underlying principles, students will also be exposed (via weekly labs) to computation methods that they can use in analysing real crime-related datasets, such as survey data, crime reports, and DNA data.

## Key Projects

#### Crime Data Collection Survey (Programming for Crime Scientists)
* Designed and implemented functions, lists and dictionaries to gather and analyze data on crime incidents
* Developed an intuitive interface allowing participants to anonymously submit information
* Contributed to a database supporting academic research and informing public safety strategies
* Aimed to provide insights into crime patterns through comprehensive data analysis with graphs and scatter plots

**Libraries**: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `csv`, `json`, `pickle`, `requests`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `random`, `math`

#### Crime Data Analysis of UK Neighborhoods (Programming for Crime Scientists)
* Developed an interface to retrieve crime information by neighborhood for specified year and month
* Enabled users to access detailed crime data for specific neighborhoods
* Integrated data visualization tools to illustrate crime patterns
* Applied kernel density estimations to analyze crime locations within neighborhoods

**Libraries**: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `csv`, `json`, `pickle`, `requests`, `pandas`, `seaborn`
